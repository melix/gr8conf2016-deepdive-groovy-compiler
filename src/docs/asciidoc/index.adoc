== Agenda

* Interpreted vs compiled
* Scripts vs classes
* Parsing
* Abstract Syntax Trees
* Resolving
* Run-time vs compile-time
* Static type checking
* Bytecode generation
* Class loading

== Interpreted vs compiled

* Groovy is a dynamic language
* Dynamic != interpreted
* Interpreted == a runtime interprets an AST
* JVM is an interpreter + a JIT
* Groovy compiles down to JVM bytecode

== Scripts vs classes
=== A Java class

```java
public class Greeter {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, "+args[0]);
    }
}
```

=== A Groovy script

```groovy
println "Hello, $args[0]"
```

=== What is the difference?

* Classes are compiled to bytecode
* Scripts are *also* compiled to bytecode
* So it's more a run-time vs compile-time discussion!

=== Compile-time

* Given a set of source files
* Compile them
* Output is bytecode
** cacheable (library, jar file, ...)
** loadable by the runtime (classloader)

=== Run-time

* Same as compile-time but...
* done during execution of the program!
* Groovy does *both*
** consequences on packaging
** consequences on the size of the runtime

=== Run-time vs runtime

* A _runtime_ provides support libraries to execute a compiled program
* Run-time is what happens at run time
* Groovy has a runtime
* Java also (the JRE, providing core classes)

== Compilation phases

* Groovy has 9 compilation phases (see `org.codehaus.groovy.control.CompilePhase`)
** initialization
** *parsing*
** *conversion*
** *semantic analysis*
** canonicalization
** instruction selection
** *class generation*
** output
** finalization

=== Visualizing compilation phases

=== Parsing

* Converts source code (text) into a concrete syntax tree (CST)
* Where we send _syntax errors_
* Groovy tries to minimize the errors at that phase
* We make use of *Antlr 2*
** Migration to *Antlr 4* in progress
* See `org.codehaus.groovy.antlr.AntlrParserPlugin`
* Limited transformations available (and not recommended)

=== Conversion

* Converts a CST into an Abstract Syntax Tree
* AST nodes are what the other compilation phases rely on
* There's already semantic information in an AST
* Earliest phase an AST transformation can hook into

=== Conversion: AST nodes

* 2 categories
** statements (`IfStatement`, `BlockStatement`, ...)
** expressions (`ConstantExpression`, `MethodCallExpression`, ...)
* Know your AST!
** particularily useful if you plan on writing AST transformations

=== Conversion: AST nodes example

```
println "Hello, $args[0]"
```

image::println-hello-ast.png[]

=== Conversion: Abstract Syntax Tree

* typically where an interpreter would step in
* at the core of the Groovy compiler
* AST classes live in `org.codehaus.groovy.ast`
* Still somehow _runtime agnostic_
** In practice, `ClassNode` already bridges to `java.lang.Class`
* Start of visitor pattern

=== Semantic analysis

* computation intensive phase
* resolves class literals (symbols in AST, imports, ...)
* resolves static imports (constants, methods) 
* computes the scope of parameters and local variables
* checks static scope vs instance scope
* updates the AST of inner classes
* collects AST transformations information

=== Canonicalization

* Finalizes the AST with information deduced from the semantic analysis
* Completes generation of AST of inner classes
* Completes enumerations with calls to `super`
* Weaves trait aspects into classes implementing traits
* Usually last chance to hook an AST transformation

=== Instruction selection

* Formely used to select the instruction set (java version, ...)
* (Optional) Type checking
* Post-type checking trait corrections
* (optional) static compiler specific AST transformations
* in short: all AST operations that need to be done just before generating bytecode

=== Class generation

* Converts an AST into bytecode
* Makes use of the ASM library
* we'll get back to it...

=== Output

* (optional) write the generated bytecode into a file

=== Finalization

* supposed to perform cleanup tasks
* Unused today!

=== Putting it altogether

* `CompilationUnit` is responsible for the compile phases lifecycle
* processes a set of `SourceUnit`
* a `SourceUnit` represents a single source file (or script)
* a `CompileUnit` gathers all ASTs of a compilation unit in a single place
** typically used for _resolution_
* all source units are processed _phase by phase_

== AST Transformations

=== What are AST xforms?

* User code that hooks into the compiler
* Allows transforming the AST during compilation
* A transform runs at a specific phases
** a best, _conversion_
** usually, _semantic analysis_
** no later than *canonicalization*
* If you do it later... all bets are off!

=== User code?

* Groovy comes with several AST xforms
* some features of the compiler are implemented as AST xforms
** traits
** static type checking

=== Static type checking

* Implemented (mostly) as an AST transformation
* Annotates AST nodes with *metadata*
* Flow typing
* *Must* be done very last in compiler phases
** `INSTRUCTION_SELECTION`

== Bytecode generation

* Groovy targets the JVM
* Android is supported by post-processing bytecode (dex)
* Bytecode generation library: ASM
* 3 different backends
** legacy
** invokedynamic
** static compilation

=== But...

* ASM is a low level API
* Groovy uses a higher level API
** `AsmCodeGenerator` : entry point, visitor pattern for the Groovy AST
** writers: `WriterController`, `BinaryExpressionWriter`, `InvocationWriter`, ... map ASTs to ASM patterns
** helpers: `BytecodeHelper`, `CompileStack`, `OperandStack` simplify the generation of bytecode
 
=== Dealing with specific runtimes

* Dedicated writer versions
** `CallSiteWriter` -> `StaticTypesCallSiteWriter`
* Optimized paths
** Primitive optimizations
** Static compilation
** Static compiler can delegate to a dynamic writer

=== Dynamic runtime

```groovy
int sum(int... values) {
   values.sum()
}
```

`groovyc example.groovy`

`javap -v example.class`

=== Dynamic runtime (2)

```
 0: invokestatic  #17       // Method $getCallSiteArray:()[Lorg/codehaus/groovy/runtime/callsite/CallSite;
 3: astore_2
 4: aload_2
 5: ldc           #42       // int 1
 7: aaload
 8: aload_1
 9: invokeinterface #45,  2 // InterfaceMethod org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/callsite/CallSite.call:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
14: invokestatic  #51       // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/typehandling/DefaultTypeTransformation.intUnbox:(Ljava/lang/Object;)I
17: ireturn
```

=== Invokedynamic runtime

`groovyc --indy example.groovy`

```
0: aload_1
1: invokedynamic #50,  0 // InvokeDynamic #1:invoke:([I)Ljava/lang/Object;
6: invokestatic  #56     // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/typehandling/DefaultTypeTransformation.intUnbox:(Ljava/lang/Object;)I
9: ireturn
```

=== Static compiler runtime

`groovyc --configscript config.groovy example.groovy`

```
0: aload_1
1: invokestatic  #38    // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/DefaultGroovyMethods.sum:([I)I
4: ireturn
```

=== Playing with bytecode generation

```groovy
int run(int i) {
   _new 'java/lang/Integer'
   dup
   iload 1
   invokespecial 'java/lang/Integer.<init>','(I)V'
   invokevirtual 'java/lang/Integer.intValue','()I'
   ireturn
}
```

=== What happens?

* An *AST transformation* is applied (`@Bytecode`)
* Transforms "bytecode-like" method calls into actual *ASM* method calls
* So allows writing "bytecode" directly as method body
* Very useful for learning purposes
* Limited to method bodies

== Classloading

* Bytecode -> `byte[]`
* Still have to load that code
* For precompiled classes, can be done by any classloader
* `GroovyClassLoader`
** supports generation of classes at *runtime*
** will cache the generated classes

=== RootLoader

* Special classloader that reverses the logic of parent vs child
* Used to implement different classpath
* Mutable

=== CallSiteClassLoader

* Used *only* on the legacy dynamic runtime
* Loads _call site classes_
* Call site class: dynamically generated classes which avoid use of reflection
